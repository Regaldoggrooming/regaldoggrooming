										<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
									</header>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Early Arrivals</h2>
										<p>
										All dogs are groomed on a one to one basis. Careful time planning has gone into being able to provide this service. Please ensure to arrive on time and no earlier than a couple of minutes as I can't take your appointment until the allocated time. If you do arrive early you’re more than welcome to wait on the drive. When collecting please arrive at the agreed time unless I've called you to tell you otherwise.
										</p>
										
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Late Arrivals</h2>
										<p>
										As careful time planning has gone into providing a quality one to one dog grooming experience it is important to arrive on time for appointments. If you are too late for an appointment, we may need to reschedule as I may not have the time to fulfil the dog grooming appointment before the next one arrives. On collecting please arrive at the agreed time as lateness can affect the next appointment as they can't be seen until you have collected your dog.
										</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Cancellations and No Shows</h2>
										<p>
										If you're unable to make the appointment 24 hours’ notice prior is needed to ensure the space can be filled. If you fail to contact me in this time frame or don’t show up for the appointment without cancelling, you will be charged full price for the missed groom at your next appointment. Payment will be taken at the time of booking and failure to do so will mean the appointment will not be taken.
										</p>
										<p>
										As an independent business I've put this in place to financially protect myself so I can continue to provide my services.
										</p>
										
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Matted Coats</h2>
<p>Under the Animal Welfare Act I do not dematt matted coats. Matted coats will be clipped off with the appropriate blade length to ensure the dog’s welfare which will be short and may not be the desired haircut, but the hair will grow back.</p>
<p>There is a fee from £5 on top of the full groom to help cover the cost of blade sharpening as cutting into a matted coat blunts and damages them.</p>
<p>If your dog is matted and must be clipped off short, the owner should be aware that irritation may occur from the process. When clipping short we may uncover pre-existing skin problems or parasites that are under the matted coat. If I notice anything I may recommend that you see a vet.</p> 
<p>Please be aware when clipping off short a matted/neglected coat there can be some after effects such as itchiness, skin redness or self- inflicted abrasions/irritations from excessive rubbing or scratching.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Fleas</h2>
<p>If fleas are found  on your dog a flea shampoo may be used. The owner should seek veterinary advice and treatment. An extra charge of £10 will be added to the full groom to help cover the cost of fumigating the salon.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Health and Wellbeing</h2>
<p>During the grooming session all care is taken to ensure health and wellbeing for your dog. However, in the event of an emergency, or a serious medical problem being discovered during the groom I shall seek veterinary care. The owner agrees That Regal Dog Grooming shall not be held liable for any pre-existing conditions and problems found, and the owner agrees to pay for all medical treatment incurred.</p>
<p>If a medical condition is found during the groom I will advise that you seek veterinary advice. I will not diagnose your pet however I may give you an indication as to that I suspect the issue is, and therefore advise you consult your vet.</p>
<p>As a dog groomer with a vision of making the grooming experience as positive and relaxing for your dog as I can Regal Dog Grooming has the right to refuse to groom any dog for risk of safety to either myself or the dog. I may stop the groom for the wellbeing of all involved if this is the case the full groom fee or time spent will still apply.</p>
<p>The owner also agrees to inform me prior to grooming if their dog has ever bitten or shown aggression at any time.</p>
<p>Please make sure to toilet your dog prior to their appointment to avoid accidents in the salon.</p>
